# File Organizer Application

### Project Description
This program will organize the files based on the file's name, file's creation time and file extensions.
For example, if we have two files with different file extensions, the program will place these two files into a file and named it with the same name.

### Difficulties that we faced during our project:
1. As we need to make sure this application can work acrross different platform for our user, we need to figure out and solve the compatibility issue.
2. There are some codes and functions that we haven't learned about such as tkinter, getctime, exe, etc. and we have to search for them on the Internet.
3. We faced some technical issues during our recording.
