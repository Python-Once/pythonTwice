# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

File Organizer

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

A program that can organize your files on your computer.

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

This program will organize the files based on the file's name and file extensions. For example, if we have two files with different file extensions, the program will place these two files into a file and named it with the same name.

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

Not applicable.

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

Sherry Sun, tur97134@temple.edu, Elmira Talebianaraki. Ason Yue, tur99851@temple.edu, Elmira Talebianaraki.

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

We can use this file organizer to arrange files based on file extensions.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

We can create this file organizer to arrange files based on file extensions and names.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

We can add additional features to organize files apart from extensions and names.

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

We need to learn and do research about Python directory, file management, and os library. Sherry will do the date management sorting and Ason will do the extension and file name sorting.
